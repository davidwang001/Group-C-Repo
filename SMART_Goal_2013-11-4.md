S.M.A.R.T. Goal:

[S] Specific: Our current goal is to create a data curation program that extracts the files from a given URL and converts it to a CSV. This raw data can then be used by both the analyzers and the visualizers to carry out the specific tasks of the assignment.

[M] Measurable: Our focus is producing a data frame that can be used by the other groups. If we can produce a data frame that other groups can implement, then we have achieved our goal. It is also important to ensure that the data frame is accurate, which is why we must conduct an integrity check.

[A] Attainable: Our technical lead has contributed significantly to the project and maintains an understanding of how to appropriately extract the data. It will also be important to coordinate with the Analyzer and Visualizer groups to ensure that they know how to use the code to extract relevant data.

[R] Relevant: This code is the first item in the conveyer belt of the project and is essential for other groups to begin their tasks.

[T] Time-Bound: This task has already been completed, and has been shared with other groups on the GitHub.
